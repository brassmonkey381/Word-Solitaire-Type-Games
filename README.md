# Wordscapes Solitaire ‚Äì Research Notebooks

This repo contains two experimental Jupyter notebooks exploring **auto-difficulty control** and **board mechanics** for a word-puzzle game inspired by *Wordscapes* and *Solitaire*.

---
Both notebooks implements a **playable game prototype** with:
- A **multi-layer depth board** (tiles block lower tiles until cleared).
- A **deck system** for drawing extra letters
- A bot programmed to always pick the longest word makable using the board + last drawn deck card(s)
- A Player stats tracking panel to display average word length and score, well as how many new words become available as a new card tile is flipped / revealed (we call this metric Œî)
- Some plots of epsilon, the dynamic difficulty tuning parameter, and it's relationship to the metric Œî.

## Notebook 1: Epsilon as a stand alone Difficulty Driver

This notebook demonstrates a **theoretical model** where difficulty is driven by a smoothly oscillating parameter, epsilon, and how it's value affects how many new words become available on card tile flips.

- **Core idea:** difficulty is a sinusoidal signal over time.
- **Epsilon (Œµ)** is clamped to `[0, 0.5]` and changes only when **new board tiles are revealed**.
- Plots show:
  - Œµ over time (with win/loss markers).
  - Œî (net options added) over time, smoothed with rolling averages.

### Equations

Target delta for a reveal is:

$$
\text{target} = (1-\varepsilon)\cdot \text{max}_{\text{delta}} + \varepsilon \cdot \text{min}_{\text{delta}}
$$

Epsilon evolves as a clamped sine wave (period = 30 reveals):

$$
\varepsilon(t) = \text{clamp}\!\left(
0.5 \sin\!\left(\tfrac{2\pi t}{30}\right)\,0\,0.5
\right)
$$

This leaves room for epsilon to be updated by other in-game events and logic.  
Some rough ideas for events that would trigger an epsilon adjustment.  We can also add decay parameters, and other functions that alter epsilon.
- Player makes an in app purchase, lower their epsilon by 10% for 24 hours (to subtly reward in-app purchase)
- Player uses several power-ups to beat a level, lower their epsilon by 10% for 5 games (to prevent churn from frustration)
- Player performance is very high or low, or player goes on a win streak or loss streak (See implementation of this idea in notebook 2!)

## Notebook 2: Depth Board + Deck + Adaptive Epsilon

- **Epsilon (Œµ)** as an **adaptive difficulty signal** in `[0,1]`.
- Automatic switching between **Easy / Normal / Hard modes** based on Œµ with **hysteresis**.

### Difficulty Modes

- **Easy:** reveal/waste pickers try to **maximize new words** and favor longer completions.
- **Normal:** letters drawn **randomly** (weighted).
- **Hard:** mostly random, but occasionally **adversarial**:
  - Picks letters that **minimize options** or reduce longest possible completions.
  - Œµ is ‚Äústicky‚Äù in Hard (floored at 0.70, slower to decrease).

### How Œµ Updates

**After each word:**

$$
\text{target} = \text{clamp01}\!\left(\frac{\text{avg}_{\text{recent-len}} - 3}{4}\right)
$$

Exponential moving average update:

$$
\varepsilon_{\text{new}} = (1-\alpha)\,\varepsilon_{\text{old}} + \alpha \cdot \text{proposed}
$$

**After each game:**
- Targets based on **game score** and **win/loss streaks**.
- Hard resets:
  - 4+ win streak ‚Üí Œµ = 1.0 (force Hard).
  - 4+ loss streak ‚Üí Œµ = 0.0 (force Easy).

## Summary

- **Notebook 1** shows a **controlled sine-wave model** for difficulty flow.  
- **Notebook 2** builds a **full game prototype** with **adaptive, performance-driven Œµ** that maps directly to Easy/Normal/Hard modes.
